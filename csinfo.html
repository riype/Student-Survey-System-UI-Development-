        <p>Welcome to the Department of Computer Science. The department offers BS, MS, and PhD programs in Computer Science.</p>
        <p>Faculty in the department have research interests in networking, architecture, parallel and distributed computing, performance evaluation,
            software engineering, multimedia, graphics and visualization, databases, software engineering, data mining, security, information systems, 
            artificial intelligence, computer vision, and robotics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Graduate classes are offered in the late afternoon and evening to accommodate the professionally employed students. Financial aid in the 
            form of graduate assistantships may be available for full- time degree-seeking students. Appropriate courses may be transferred, with advisor
            approval, into the degree program. The Department of Computer Science offers additional degrees and certificates that are of interest to many
            MS students. Graduate certificates in computer networking, information security and assurance, and software engineering are available. 
            Course work toward the certificates can be used for credit toward the MS in Computer Science. However, the certificates also may be pursued 
            concurrently with any of the graduate degree programs in the Volgenau School of Engineering.
